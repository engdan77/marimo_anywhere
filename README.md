# Marimo Anywhere

Marimo Anywhere is a small toolkit for "minifying" **Marimo** notebooks from the command line and scripts to allow sharing them easily and within limitations that exists share embedded/encoded code within URL.

## Motivation
It focuses on practical workflows like:

- Turning notebooks into portable artifacts (e.g., minified sources into standalone Python files or URLs)
- Driving notebook-related tasks in repeatable CLI commands
- Supporting automation use-cases (local runs, CI, and simple scripting)

This repository is intentionally lightweight and aims to provide composable utilities you can wire into your own workflow.
